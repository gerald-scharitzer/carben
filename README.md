# Carben

Get the carbon intensity of energy systems.

# Rationale

The availability of low-carbon energy varies in space and time.
Varying the production and consumption of energy in space or time changes the total emissions.
Get the carbon intensity of the constituents to optimize the carbon intensity of the system.
